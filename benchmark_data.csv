1_4,Sequences and Limits,"Suppose that $a_n$ and $b_n$ converge to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as $n \to \infty$ respectively. Show that the sequence
$$
\frac{a_0 b_n + a_1 b_{n-1} + \cdots + a_n b_0}{n}
$$
converges to $\alpha \beta$ as $n \to \infty$.","Let $M$ be an upper bound of the two convergent sequences $|a_n|$ and $|b_n|$. For any $\epsilon > 0$ we can take a positive integer $N$ satisfying $|a_n - \alpha| < \epsilon$ and $|b_n - \beta| < \epsilon$ for all integers $n$ greater than $N$. If $n$ is greater than $N^2$, then
$$
|a_k b_{n-k} - \alpha \beta| \leq |(a_k - \alpha) b_{n-k} + \alpha (b_{n-k} - \beta)| 
\leq (M + |\alpha|) \epsilon
$$
for any integer $k$ in the interval $\left[\sqrt{n}, n - \sqrt{n}\right]$. Therefore
$$
\left| \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} - \alpha \beta \right| 
\leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{\sqrt{n} \leq k \leq n - \sqrt{n}} |a_k b_{n-k} - \alpha \beta|

$$
$$
\leq (M + |\alpha|) \epsilon + 2 \left(|\alpha \beta| + M^2\right) \frac{\sqrt{n} + 1}{n}.
$$

We can take $n$ so large that the last expression is less than $(M + |\alpha| + 1)\epsilon$."
1_6,Sequences and Limits,"For any positive sequence $\{a_n\}_{n \geq 1}$, show that
$$
\left( \frac{a_1 + a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right)^n > e
$$
for infinitely many $n$'s, where $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm. Prove moreover that the constant $e$ on the right-hand side cannot in general be replaced by any larger number.","Without loss of generality we may put $a_1 = 1$. Suppose, contrary to the conclusion, that there is an integer $N$ satisfying
$$
\left(\frac{1 + a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right)^n \leq e
$$
for all $n \geq N$. Put
$$
s_{j,k} = \exp\left(\frac{1}{j} + \cdots + \frac{1}{k}\right)
$$
for any integers $j \leq k$. Since $0 < a_{n+1} \leq e^{1/n} a_n - 1$, we get successively
$$
\begin{cases}
0 < a_{n+1} \leq s_{n,n} a_n - 1, \\
0 < a_{n+2} \leq s_{n,n+1} a_n - s_{n+1,n+1} - 1, \\
\vdots \\
0 < a_{n+k+1} \leq s_{n,n+k} a_n - s_{n+1,n+k} - \cdots - s_{n+k,n+k} - 1
\end{cases}
$$
for any non-negative integer $k$. Hence it follows that
$$
a_n > \frac{1}{s_{n,n}} + \frac{1}{s_{n,n+1}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{s_{n,n+k}}.
$$

On the other hand, using the inequality
$$
\frac{1}{s_{n,n+j}} > \exp\left(-\int_{n-1}^{n+j} \frac{dx}{x}\right) = \frac{n-1}{n+j},
$$
we get
$$
a_n > \sum_{j=0}^k \frac{n-1}{n+j},
$$
which is a contradiction, since the right-hand side diverges to $\infty$ as $k \to \infty$.

To see that the bound $e$ cannot be replaced by any larger number, consider the case $a_n = n \log n$ for $n \geq 2$. Then
$$
\left(\frac{a_1 + (n+1)\log(n+1)}{n \log n}\right)^n = \exp\left(n \log\left(1 + \frac{1}{n} + O\left(\frac{1}{n \log n}\right)\right)\right)
$$
$$
= \exp\left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{\log n}\right)\right),
$$
which converges to $e$ as $n \to \infty$.
"
1_5,Sequences and Limits,"Suppose that $\{a_n\}_{n \geq 0}$ is a non-negative sequence satisfying
$$
a_{m+n} \leq a_m + a_n + C
$$
for all positive integers $m, n$ and some non-negative constant $C$. Show that $a_n / n$ converges as $n \to \infty$.","For an arbitrary fixed positive integer $k$ we put $n = qk + r$ with $0 \leq r < k$. Since $a_n = a_{qk+r} \leq q(a_k + C) + a_r$, we have
$$
\frac{a_n}{n} \leq \frac{a_k + C}{k} + \frac{a_r}{n}.
$$
Taking the limit as $n \to \infty$, we get
$$
\limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{n} \leq \frac{a_k + C}{k}.
$$
The sequence $a_n / n$ is therefore bounded. Since $k$ is arbitrary, we may conclude that
$$
\limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{n} \leq \liminf_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{k},
$$
which means the convergence of $a_n / n$. 
"
1_8,Sequences and Limits,"For any real number $\theta$ and any positive integer $n$, show the inequality
$$
\frac{\cos\theta}{2} + \frac{\cos 2\theta}{3} + \cdots + \frac{\cos n\theta}{n+1} \geq -\frac{1}{2}.
$$","The proof is substantially based on Verblunsky (1945). Write $\theta$ for $2\vartheta$ for brevity. Let $c_n(\vartheta)$ be the left-hand side of the inequality to be shown. It suffices to confine ourselves to the interval $[0, \pi/2]$. Clearly $c_1(\vartheta) = \cos\vartheta/2 \geq -1/2$ and
$$
c_2(\vartheta) = \frac{2}{3} \cos^2\vartheta + \frac{1}{2} \cos\vartheta - \frac{1}{3} \geq -\frac{41}{96},
$$
and we assume that $n \geq 3$. Note that
$$
\cos n\theta = \frac{\sin(2n+1)\vartheta - \sin(2n-1)\vartheta}{2\sin\vartheta}
= \frac{\sin^2(n+1)\vartheta - 2\sin^2 n\vartheta + \sin^2(n-1)\vartheta}{2\sin^2\vartheta},
$$
whose numerator is the second difference of the positive sequence $\{\sin^2 n\vartheta\}$. Using this formula we get
$$
c_n(\vartheta) = \frac{1}{2\sin^2\vartheta} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\sin^2(k+1)\vartheta - 2\sin^2k\vartheta + \sin^2(k-1)\vartheta}{k+1},
$$
which can be written as
$$
\frac{1}{2\sin^2\vartheta} \left(-\frac{2\sin^2\vartheta}{3} + \frac{\sin^2 2\vartheta}{12} + \cdots + \frac{2\sin^2(n-1)\vartheta}{n(n^2-1)}
-\frac{(n-1)\sin^2n\vartheta}{n(n+1)} + \frac{\sin^2(n+1)\vartheta}{n+1}\right).
$$

Hence we obtain
$$
c_n(\vartheta) \geq -\frac{1}{6} + \frac{\cos^2\vartheta}{6} + \frac{\sin^2(n+1)\vartheta - \sin^2n\vartheta}{2(n+1)\sin^2\vartheta}.
$$
For any $\vartheta$ satisfying $\sin(2n+1)\vartheta \geq 0$, we obviously have $c_n(\vartheta) \geq -1/3$. Moreover, if $\vartheta$ belongs to the interval $(3\pi/(2n+1), \pi/2)$, then using Jordan's inequality $\sin\vartheta \geq 2\vartheta/\pi$,
$$
c_n(\vartheta) \geq -\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{2(n+1)\sin(3\pi/(2n+1))}
\geq -\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2n+1}{12(n+1)} > -\frac{1}{2}.
$$
Thus it suffices to consider the interval $[\pi/(2n+1), 2\pi/(2n+1)]$.

In general, we consider an interval of the form
$$
\left[\frac{\alpha\pi}{2n+1}, \frac{\beta\pi}{2n+1}\right].
$$
For any $\vartheta$ satisfying $\sin(2n+1)\vartheta \leq c$ on this interval, it follows that
$$
c_n(\vartheta) \geq -\frac{1}{6} - \frac{\sin^2\vartheta}{6} - \frac{c}{2(n+1)\sin\vartheta}.
$$

Now the right-hand side can be written as $-1/6 - \varphi(\sin\vartheta)$, where $\varphi(x)$ is a concave function; hence, the maximum of $\varphi$ is attained at an endpoint of that interval. By using
$$
\alpha\pi\sin\vartheta \geq 7\vartheta\sin\frac{\alpha\pi}{7},
$$
we get
$$
\varphi\left(\sin\frac{\alpha\pi}{2n+1}\right) = \frac{1}{6} \sin^2\frac{\alpha\pi}{2n+1} + \frac{c}{2(n+1)\sin(\alpha\pi/(2n+1))}
$$
$$
\leq \frac{(\alpha\pi)^2}{6(2n+1)^2} + \frac{c}{2(n+1)} \cdot \frac{2n+1}{7\sin(\alpha\pi/7)}.
$$

Since $n \geq 3$, the last expression is less than
$$
\frac{(\alpha\pi)^2}{294} + \frac{c}{7\sin(\alpha\pi/7)}.
$$

Similarly, we get an estimate for another endpoint. For $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=4/3$, we can take $c=\sqrt{3}/2$ so that the value of $\varphi$ at the corresponding endpoint is less than 0.319 and 0.28 respectively. Similarly for $\alpha=4/3$ and $\beta=2$, we can take $c=1$ so that the value of $\varphi$ is less than 0.314 and 0.318 respectively. Therefore the maximum of $\varphi$ on the interval $[\pi/(2n+1), 2\pi/(2n+1)]$ is less than $1/3$, which implies that $c_n(\vartheta) > -1/2$.

2_11,Infinite Series,"Making use of the formula
\[
\frac{\sin(2n+1)\theta}{(2n+1)\sin \theta} = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\sin^2 k\pi / (2n+1)} \right),
\]
show that
\[
\frac{\sin \pi x}{\pi x} = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left( 1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2} \right)
\]
holds for all real $x$.","Since it is easily verified that $\sin(2n+1)\theta$ is a polynomial of $\sin \theta$ by induction, we can write
\[
p_n(\sin^2 \theta) = \frac{\sin(2n+1)\theta}{\sin \theta}
\]
where $p_n(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ satisfying $p_n(0) = 2n+1$. The zeros of $p_n(x)$ can be obtained by solving the equation $\sin(2n+1)\theta = 0$ with $\sin \theta \neq 0$; therefore we get the following $n$ points:
\[
\sin^2 \xi_{1,n} < \sin^2 \xi_{2,n} < \cdots < \sin^2 \xi_{n,n}
\]
in the interval $(0,1)$ where $\xi_{k,n} = k\pi/(2n+1) \in (0, \pi/2)$. Hence we have
\[
\sin(2n+1)\theta = (2n+1) \sin \theta \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \xi_{k,n}}\right).
\]

By the substitution $x = (2n+1)\theta/\pi$,
\[
\frac{\sin \pi x}{\pi x} \cdot \frac{x_n}{\sin x_n} = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{\sin^2 x_n}{\sin^2 \xi_{k,n}}\right),
\]
where $x_n = \pi x / (2n+1)$.

We can assume $x$ is not an integer; otherwise, the expansion clearly holds. Take any positive integers $n$ and $m$ satisfying $n > m > |x|$ so that $|x_n| < \xi_{k,n}$. Putting
\[
\eta_{m,n} = \prod_{k=m+1}^n \left(1 - \frac{\sin^2 x_n}{\sin^2 \xi_{k,n}}\right),
\]
we get
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\eta_{m,n}} = \frac{\pi x}{\sin \pi x} \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{k^2}\right).
\]

On the other hand,
\[
1 > \eta_{m,n} \geq 1 - \sum_{k=m+1}^n \frac{\sin^2 x_n}{\sin^2 \xi_{k,n}}
\]
since
\[
(1 - \alpha_1)(1 - \alpha_2) \cdots (1 - \alpha_n) \geq 1 - \alpha_1 - \cdots - \alpha_n
\]
for any $0 < \alpha_k < 1$ and any positive integer $N$. Using now the inequalities
\[
\frac{2\theta}{\pi} < \sin \theta < \theta
\]
holding for $0 < \theta < \pi/2$,
\[
\eta_{m,n} \geq 1 - \frac{\pi^2}{4} \sum_{k=m+1}^n \frac{x_n^2}{\xi_{k,n}^2} \geq 1 - \frac{\pi^2 x^2}{4m},
\]
since
\[
\sum_{k=m+1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} < \frac{1}{m}.
\]

Hence $\lim_{n \to \infty} \eta_{m,n}$ converges to $1$ as $m \to \infty$."
2_3,Infinite Series,"For any positive sequence $\{a_n\}_{n \geq 1}$ show the inequality
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n)^{1/n} < e \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n.
\]

Prove further that the constant $e$ on the right-hand side cannot in general be replaced by any smaller number.","The proof is based on PÃ³lya (1926). Let $\{b_n\}$ be an arbitrary positive sequence. First we write
\[
\sum_{n=1}^m (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n)^{1/n} = \sum_{n=1}^m \left( \frac{a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 \cdots a_n b_n}{b_1 b_2 \cdots b_n} \right)^{1/n}.
\]

Using the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality on the right-hand side, the above sum is less than or equal to
\[
\sum_{n=1}^m \frac{1}{(b_1 b_2 \cdots b_n)^{1/n}} \cdot \frac{a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \cdots + a_n b_n}{n}
= \sum_{k=1}^m a_k b_k \sum_{n=k}^m \frac{1}{n (b_1 b_2 \cdots b_n)^{1/n}}.
\]

We now take 
\[
b_n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n
\]
so that $(b_1 b_2 \cdots b_n)^{1/n} = n + 1$. Therefore we have
\[
\sum_{k=1}^m a_k b_k \sum_{n=k}^m \frac{1}{n (n+1)} = \sum_{k=1}^m a_k b_k \left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{m+1} \right)
< \sum_{k=1}^m a_k \left( 1 + \frac{1}{k} \right)^k
\]
and this is smaller than $e \sum_{k=1}^m a_k$. Note that the equality does not occur in the original inequality when $m \to \infty$.

To see that $e$ cannot be replaced by any smaller number, we take, for example,
\[
a_n = 
\begin{cases} 
n^{-1} & \text{for } 1 \leq n \leq m, \\
2^{-n} & \text{for } n > m,
\end{cases}
\]
where $m$ is an integer parameter. Then it is not hard to see that
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n)^{1/n} = \sum_{n=1}^m n^{1-1/n} + O(1)
= e \log m + O(1),
\]
and
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^m \frac{1}{n} = \log m + O(1),
\]
which implies that the ratio of the above two sums converges to $e$ as $m \to \infty$."

\[

\sigma_n = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n},
\]
where $\epsilon_n$ is a sequence converging to $0$.

We now show that
\[
\sigma_n = \frac{\alpha}{n} - \frac{\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2 + \cdots + \epsilon_{n-1}}{n} + \epsilon_n \tag{2.3}
\]
by induction on $n$. The case $n=1$ is clear, since $\sigma_1 = a_1 = \alpha + \epsilon_1$. Suppose next that $(2.3)$ holds for $n=m$. We then have
\[
\sigma_{m+1} = \frac{m}{m+1} \sigma_m + \frac{a_{m+1}}{m+1}
\]
\[
= \frac{m}{m+1} \left( \frac{\alpha}{m} - \frac{\epsilon_1 + \cdots + \epsilon_{m-1}}{m} + \epsilon_m \right) + \frac{a_{m+1}}{m+1}
\]
\[
= \frac{\alpha}{m+1} - \frac{\epsilon_1 + \cdots + \epsilon_m}{m+1} + \epsilon_{m+1},

This is bounded above as follows:
\[

3_5,Continuous Functions,"Show that there are no continuous functions $f$, $g$, and $h$ defined on $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying

\[
h(f(x) + g(y)) = xy

for all $x$ and $y$, the function $h(x)$ must be surjective onto $\mathbb{R}$ since $xy$ takes all real values. Now if $f(x) = f(x')$, then
\[
x = h(f(x) + g(1)) = h(f(x') + g(1)) = x'.
\]
Thus $f(x)$ is one-to-one and hence strictly monotone. Suppose that $f$ is bounded above. The limit of $f(x)$ as $x \to \infty$ exists, say $a$. We then see that
\[
h(a + g(1)) = \lim_{x \to \infty} h(f(x) + g(1)) = \lim_{x \to \infty} x = \infty,

a contradiction. Thus $f(x)$ is unbounded above. The similar argument can be applied when $x \to -\infty$. Therefore $f$ is one-to-one onto $\mathbb{R}$. Since

is also a dense set; thus we can choose a point $x^* > 1$ which belongs to all the sets $E_n$. Namely, there exist two integers $k_n \geq n$ and $m_n$ satisfying

|x| > \sqrt{1 - 1/n^2} > \cos\frac{\pi}{2n}.
\]

The $n$th Chebyshev polynomial $T_n(x)$ of the first kind (See Chapter 15) is factorized as
\[
T_n(x) = (x-\xi_1) \cdots (x-\xi_n)
\]
where 
\[
\xi_k = \cos\frac{2k-1}{2n}\pi
\]
for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$. The Lagrange interpolation polynomial for $Q$ with nodes $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_n$ is
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{Q(\xi_k)}{T_n'(\xi_k)} \cdot \frac{T_n(x)}{x-\xi_k} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}Q(\xi_k) \sqrt{1-\xi_k^2} \frac{T_n(x)}{x-\xi_k},
\]
which is a polynomial of degree less than $n$; hence it coincides with the polynomial $Q(x)$. Using the fact that $\mathrm{sgn}(x-\xi_k)$ is independent of $k$ in view of $\xi_1 < |x| \leq 1$, we get
\[
|Q(x)| \leq \frac{M}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n \left| \frac{T_n(x)}{x-\xi_k} \right| = \frac{M}{n^2} \left| T_n'(x) \right|.
\]

Since 
\[
|T_n'(\cos\theta)| = n \frac{|\sin n\theta|}{|\sin\theta|} \leq n^2,
\]
we get $|Q(x)| \leq M$, as required.

By the substitution $x = \cos\theta$, our inequality is equivalent to
\[
\max_\theta |Q(\cos\theta)| \leq n \max_\theta |\sin\theta Q(\cos\theta)|,
\]
which is valid for all polynomial $Q$ with complex coefficients of degree $n-1$. Let $S(\theta)$ be a linear combination over $\mathbb{C}$ of $1, \cos\theta, \cos 2\theta, \ldots, \cos n\theta$ and $\sin\theta, \sin 2\theta, \ldots, \sin n\theta$. For any $\omega$ and $\theta$ we put
\[
S_0(\theta) = \frac{S(\omega+\theta) - S(\omega-\theta)}{2}.
\]
Since $S_0(\theta)$ is an odd function, this is a linear combination of $1, \sin\theta, \ldots, \sin n\theta$ only. Thus $S_0(\theta)/\sin\theta$ is a polynomial in $\cos\theta$ of degree less than $n$, since $\sin k\theta / \sin\theta$ can be expressed as a polynomial in $\cos\theta$ of degree $k-1$. Applying our inequality to this polynomial in $\cos\theta$, we have
\[
\max_\theta \left| \frac{S_0(\theta)}{\sin\theta} \right| \leq n \max_\theta |S_0(\theta)| \leq n \max_\theta |S(\theta)|.
\]

Therefore
\[
\lim_{\theta \to 0} \frac{S_0(\theta)}{\sin\theta} = \lim_{\theta \to 0} S_0'(\theta) = S'(\omega),
\]
which implies that
\[
\max_\theta |S'(\theta)| \leq n \max_\theta |S(\theta)|.
\]
This is called Bernstein's inequality (1912b).

Two inequalities stated in the problem can be solved by using Bernstein's inequality. Let $P(x)$ be any polynomial with complex coefficients of degree $n$. Then $P(\cos\theta)$ is a linear combination of $1, \cos\theta, \ldots, \cos n\theta$ and it follows from Bernstein's inequality that
\[
\max_{-1 \leq x \leq 1} \sqrt{1-x^2} |P'(x)| = \max_\theta |\sin\theta P'(\cos\theta)| \leq n \max_\theta |P(\cos\theta)| = nM.
\]

Therefore, since $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n-1$, we get
\[
\max_{-1 \leq x \leq 1} |P'(x)| \leq n \max_{-1 \leq x \leq 1} \sqrt{1-x^2} |P'(x)| \leq n^2 M.
\]

We first consider any point $x$ which can be expressed in the form $k/2^m$ with some odd integer $k$ and non-negative integer $m$. For any integer $n \geq m$ put $h_n = 1/2^n$ for brevity. Then for any integer $\ell$ in $[0, n]$ there are no integers nor half-integers in the interval $(2^\ell x, 2^\ell(x + h_n))$. For if $2^\ell x < p/2 < 2^\ell x + 2^\ell h_n$ for some integer $p$, then we would have $2^n x = k 2^{n-m} < 2^{n-\ell-1} p < k 2^{n-m} + 1$, a contradiction. This means that $g(x)$ is a linear function having the slope 1 or $-1$ on this subinterval. Hence
\[
\frac{T(x + h_n) - T(x)}{h_n} = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \frac{g(2^\ell (x + h_n)) - g(2^\ell x)}{2^\ell h_n} = \sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1} \frac{g(2^\ell x + 2^\ell h_n) - g(2^\ell x)}{2^{\ell-n}}
\]
is a finite sum of 1 or $-1$, which does not converge as $n \to \infty$.

Next consider any point $x$ for which $2^n x$ is not an integer for all positive integer $n$. Since $2^n x$ is not an integer, we can find two positive numbers $h_n$ and $h_n'$ satisfying $[2^n x] = 2^n (x - h_n')$ and $[2^n x] + 1 = 2^n (x + h_n)$. Note that $h_n + h_n' = 2^{-n}$. Then for any integer $\ell$ in $[0, n]$ there are no integers nor half-integers in the interval $(2^\ell (x - h_n'), 2^\ell (x + h_n))$. For if $p/2$ were contained in this interval for some integer $p$, then we have $[2^n x] < 2^{n-\ell-1} p < [2^n x] + 1$, a contradiction. Therefore
\[
\frac{T(x + h_n) - T(x - h_n')}{h_n + h_n'} = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \frac{g(2^\ell (x + h_n)) - g(2^\ell (x - h_n'))}{2^\ell (h_n + h_n')} = \sum_{\ell=0}^{n-1} \frac{g(2^\ell x + 2^\ell h_n) - g(2^\ell x - 2^\ell h_n')}{2^{\ell-n}}

\[
\sigma_{a,b}(f) = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx.
\]

We first show that \( \phi \in V \). Since \( \phi \) is an even function, it suffices to consider only two cases: \( 0 \leq a < b \) and \( a < 0 < b \). If \( 0 \leq a < b \), then
\[
\sigma_{a,b}(\phi) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1+a} + \sqrt{1+b}} < 2 \phi(b).

Moreover, for any \( f \in V \) and \( \lambda > 0 \), the function \( \tilde{f} \) defined by \( \tilde{f}(x) = f(\lambda x) \) belongs to \( V \) in view of
\[
\sigma_{a,b}(\tilde{f}) = \sigma_{\lambda a, \lambda b}(f) < 4 \min\{f(\lambda a), f(\lambda b)\} = 4 \min\{\tilde{f}(a), \tilde{f}(b)\}.
\]
This means that every \( \psi_k(x) \) defined above belongs to \( V \).

Hence, noting that
\[
\left| \int_0^x \psi_n(t) \, dt \right| \leq 4 \psi_n(0),

we infer that the series \( \Psi(x) \) given in (5.3) converges absolutely and uniformly for \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \). Therefore, \( \Psi(x) \) is continuous on the interval \( [0, 1] \).

We then take a sufficiently small number \( \delta > 0 \) such that
\[

We next suppose that (5.1) holds for \( n = m - 1 \); that is,
\[
\max_{0 \leq x \leq 1} \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \psi_k(x) < 1 - \frac{1}{m+1}.

\[
\psi(x, \lambda) = \sum_{\ell=1}^{3^m} c_{\ell,m} \phi\left(\lambda \left(x - \alpha_{\ell,m}\right)\right).

\[
\lim_{\lambda \to \infty} \psi(x, \lambda) = 
\begin{cases} 
c_{\ell,m}, & \text{if } x = \alpha_{\ell,m}, \\
0, & \text{otherwise},

we can take a sufficiently large \( \lambda_m > 3^{5m+1} \) such that \( \psi(\alpha_{\ell,m}, \lambda_m) = \psi_k(\alpha_{\ell,m}) \) is sufficiently close to \( c_{\ell,m} \) for all \( 1 \leq \ell \leq 3^m \). Substituting this in (5.7), we conclude that
\[
1 - \frac{1}{m+1} < \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \psi_k(\alpha_{\ell,m}) < 1 - \frac{1}{m+2}.

This shows that (5.1) and (5.2) hold for \( n = m \).

By the property (a), we see that the partial sums of

\[
A = \{\alpha_{\ell,m} ; 1 \leq \ell \leq 3^m, m \geq 0\}

\[
B = \{\beta_{k,n} ; 0 \leq k \leq 3^n, n \geq 0\}.
\]
\( B \) is also a dense subset of \( [0,1] \) satisfying \( A \cap B = \emptyset \). Since
\[
\left| \alpha_{j,m} - \beta_{k,n} \right| = \left| \frac{2j - 1}{2 \cdot 3^m} - \frac{k}{3^n} \right| \geq \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3^m},

\[
\psi_m(\beta_{k,n}) = \sum_{j=1}^{3^m} c_{j,m} \phi\left(\lambda_m \left(\beta_{k,n} - \alpha_{j,m}\right)\right) < 3^m \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 3^m}{\lambda_m}} < \frac{1}{3^m}.

Therefore,
\[
\Phi(\beta_{k,n}) = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \psi_m(\beta_{k,n}) + \sum_{m=n}^\infty \psi_m(\beta_{k,n})
< 1 - \frac{1}{n+1} + \sum_{m=n}^\infty \frac{1}{3^m},

\]","Let \( f(s) \) be the integral in the problem. It is easily seen that
\[
e^{-4s} f(s) = \int_0^\infty \exp\left(-\left(x + \frac{s}{x}\right)^2\right) dx.
\]
Differentiating both sides, we get
\[
\left(f'(s) - 4f(s)\right)e^{-4s} = -2 \int_0^\infty \left(1 + \frac{s}{x^2}\right) \exp\left(-\left(x + \frac{s}{x}\right)^2\right) dx,
\]
where the differentiation under the integral sign is allowed (see the introduction of Chapter 11). Then, by the substitution \( t = x - s/x \), we have
\[
f'(s) - 4f(s) = -2 \int_0^\infty \left(1 + \frac{s}{x^2}\right) \exp\left(-\left(x + \frac{s}{x}\right)^2\right) dx
= -2 \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-t^2} dt = -2 \sqrt{\pi}.
\]

Solving this linear differential equation, we get
\[
f(s) = c e^{4s} + \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]
for some constant \( c \). Since \( 0 < f(s) < (\sqrt{\pi}/2)e^{2s} \), we have \( c = 0 \); hence
\[
f(s) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}.

\frac{L}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(nh)

converges to the integral
\[
\int_0^L f(x) \, dx \quad \text{as } N \to \infty.

By the monotonicity of \( g(x) \), the right-hand side is less than or equal to

\[
\left( 1 - 2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n x^n \right)^2 = 1 - 4x

that $a_1 = 1$ and the recursion formula
\[
a_{n+1} = a_1 a_n + a_2 a_{n-1} + \cdots + a_n a_1

\[
a_{2k+1} = 2(a_1 a_{2k} + \cdots + a_k a_{k+1})
\]
is an even integer for any positive integer $k$.

Suppose now that there exists a non-negative integer $\ell$ such that $a_n$ is even for every $n = 2^\ell(2k+1)$ with $k \geq 1$. Then
\[
a_{2n} = 2(a_1 a_{2n-1} + a_2 a_{2n-2} + \cdots + a_{n-1} a_{n+1}) + a_n^2

implies that $a_{2n}$ is also even for every
\[
n = 2^\ell(2k+1)

\[
\sum_{j=0}^n \frac{s_j}{a_i + a_j + 1} = \frac{1}{m + a_i + 1} \quad \text{for } 0 \leq i \leq n.

Here the coefficient matrix
\[
A = \bigg(\frac{1}{a_i + a_j + 1}\bigg)_{0 \leq i, j \leq n} \in M_{n+1}(\mathbb{R})

is symmetric and the determinant can be written explicitly as
\[
\det A = \frac{\prod_{0 \leq i < j \leq n} (a_i - a_j)^2}{\prod_{0 \leq i, j \leq n} (a_i + a_j + 1)}.

I_n^* = \frac{\det B}{\det A} = \frac{1}{2m + 1} \prod_{k=0}^n \bigg(\frac{a_k - m}{a_k + m + 1}\bigg)^2.

where $M = \int_0^1 f^2(x) dx$. Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary,
\[
\int_0^1 x^m f(x) dx = 0 \quad \text{for any positive integer } m \text{ satisfying } m \neq a_n \text{ for all } n \geq 0.

\[
\Delta(x+h, x) = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}

Letting \(h \to 0+\), we get \(\Delta(\alpha x, x) \geq f'(x)\) if the derivative exists; in other words,
\[
f(\alpha x) \geq f(x) + (\alpha - 1)x f'(x).
\]

For brevity put
\[
F(x) = x^s \exp\left(-\frac{f(x)}{x}\right) \quad \text{and} \quad G(x) = x^s \exp\left(-f'(x)\right).

Note that the improper integral

\]
converges at \(x = 0\) for any \(s > -1\) when \(f(0) > 0\) or when \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f'(0+)\) exists, since \(f'(0+) \leq f(x)/x\) in the latter case. The convergence at \(x = \infty\) also follows. By the substitution \(x = \alpha t\), we have
\[
\int_{0}^{L} F(x) \, dx = \alpha^{s+1} \int_{0}^{L/\alpha} t^s \exp\left(-\frac{f(\alpha t)}{\alpha t}\right) dt
\]
\[
\leq \alpha^{s+1} \int_{0}^{L/\alpha} F^{1/\alpha}(t) G^{(\alpha - 1)/\alpha}(t) \, dt
\]
for any \(L > 0\). Applying HÃ¶lder's inequality, the right-hand side is less than or equal to
\[
\alpha^{s+1} \left( \int_{0}^{L/\alpha} F(x) \, dx \right)^{1/\alpha} \left( \int_{0}^{L/\alpha} G(x) \, dx \right)^{(\alpha - 1)/\alpha}
\]
and replacing \(L/\alpha\) by \(L\), we have
\[
\int_{0}^{L} F(x) \, dx \leq \phi^{s+1}(\alpha) \int_{0}^{L} G(x) \, dx
\]
where \(\phi(\alpha) = \alpha^{\alpha/(\alpha-1)}\) is strictly monotone increasing on the interval \((1, \infty)\). By letting \(\alpha \to 1+\), we get
\[
\int_{0}^{L} F(x) \, dx \leq e^{s+1} \int_{0}^{L} G(x) \, dx
\]
\[
= \int_{0}^{eL} t^s \exp\left(-f'\left(\frac{t}{e}\right)\right) dt.
\]
The desired inequality follows by letting \(L \to \infty\).

To see that the constant \(e\) is best possible, we take \(f(x) = x^\beta\) for any \(\beta > 1\). Then it is not hard to see that
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} F(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{\beta - 1} \Gamma\left(\frac{s+1}{\beta - 1}\right)
\]
and
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} G(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{(\beta - 1)\beta^{(s+1)/(\beta - 1)}} \Gamma\left(\frac{s+1}{\beta - 1}\right),

f\left( \frac{1}{\sigma} \int_a^b g(x)p(x) \, dx \right) \leq \frac{1}{\sigma} \int_a^b f(g(x))p(x) \, dx.
\]","We divide the interval $[a, b]$ into $n$ equal parts and put
\[
\lambda_k = \int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} p(x) \, dx \geq 0;
\]
for any subinterval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$ so that $\sigma = \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k$. It follows from the first mean value theorem that
\[
\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} g(x)p(x) \, dx = \lambda_k g(\xi_k)
\]
for some $\xi_k \in (t_{k-1}, t_k)$. Applying the inequality in \textbf{Problem 9.4} to $n$ points $x_k = g(\xi_k)$ in $[m, M]$, we obtain
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{\sigma} \int_a^b g(x)p(x) \, dx\right) = f\left(\frac{1}{\sigma} \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k g(\xi_k)\right)
\]
\[
\leq \frac{1}{\sigma} \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k f(g(\xi_k))
= \frac{b - a}{\sigma n} \sum_{k=1}^n f(g(\xi_k)) p(\eta_k)
\]
for some $\eta_k \in (t_{k-1}, t_k)$. By the uniform continuity of $p(x)$, the difference between the expression on the right-hand side and one with $p(\xi_k)$ replaced by $p(\eta_k)$ is sufficiently small whenever $n$ is sufficiently large. Therefore the right-hand side converges to
\[
\frac{1}{\sigma} \int_a^b f(g(x))p(x) \, dx
\]
as $n \to \infty$."
9_8,Convex Functions,"Let $I$ be a closed interval of the form either $[0, a]$ or $[0, \infty)$. Suppose that $f \in C(I)$ satisfies $f(0) = 0$. Show then that $f$ is convex if and only if
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} f(x_k) \geq f\left( \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} x_k \right)
\]
for any integer $n \geq 2$ and any $n$ points $x_1 \geq x_2 \geq \cdots \geq x_{n-1} \geq x_n$ in the interval $I$.","Suppose first that $f$ is convex on the closed interval $I$. Let $x_1 > x_2 > x_3$ be arbitrary three points in $I$ and define a positive number $\lambda$ with $x_2 = \lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_3$. Since $f$ is convex, it follows from \textbf{Problem 9.4} that
\[
f(x_2) = f(\lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_3) \leq \lambda f(x_1) + (1-\lambda)f(x_3)
\]
and
\[
f((1-x_2+x_3)) = f((1-\lambda)x_1 + \lambda x_3) \leq (1-\lambda)f(x_1) + \lambda f(x_3);
\]
therefore we have
\[
f(x_2) + f(x_1-x_2+x_3) \leq f(x_1) + f(x_3),
\]
which is also valid for any $x_1 \geq x_2 \geq x_3$ in $I$ by the continuity of $f$. If we take $x_3 = 0$, then clearly $f(x_1-x_2) \leq f(x_1)-f(x_2)$ by virtue of $f(0) = 0$. We thus have the inequality in the problem for the cases $n=2$ and $3$. Suppose now the inequality holds for $n=m+2$. Then for any $m+2$ points $x_1 \geq x_2 \geq \cdots \geq x_{m+2}$ in the interval $I$,
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{m+2} (-1)^{k-1} f(x_k) \geq f(x_1)-f(x_2)+f \left( \sum_{k=3}^{m+2} (-1)^{k-1} x_k \right),
\]
which means that the inequality holds for $n=m+2$; therefore for every $n \geq 2$.

Conversely suppose the case $n=3$:
\[
f(x_2)+f(x_1-x_2+x_3) \leq f(x_1)+f(x_3)
\]
for any points $x_1 \geq x_2 \geq x_3$ in $I$. By taking $x_2 = (x_1+x_3)/2$ we get
\[
f\left(\frac{x_1+x_3}{2}\right) \leq \frac{f(x_1)+f(x_3)}{2};
\]
hence $f$ is convex on $I$."
9_4,Convex Functions,"Suppose that $f(x)$ is convex and continuous on an interval $I$. Show that 
\[
f\left( \frac{\lambda_1 x_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n x_n}{\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n} \right) 
\leq 
\frac{\lambda_1 f(x_1) + \cdots + \lambda_n f(x_n)}{\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n}
\]
for any $n$ points $x_1, \dots, x_n$ in $I$ and any positive numbers $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n$.","By the inequality in \textbf{Problem 9.1}, it is easily seen that
\[
f\left(\frac{k_1x_1 + \cdots + k_nx_n}{k_1 + \cdots + k_n}\right) \leq \frac{k_1f(x_1) + \cdots + k_nf(x_n)}{k_1 + \cdots + k_n}
\]
for any points $x_1, \dots, x_n$ in $I$ and any positive integers $k_1, \dots, k_n$. For any sufficiently large integer $N$, we take $k_j = \lfloor \lambda_j N / (\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n) \rfloor$ for each $1 \leq j \leq n$. Since
\[
\frac{k_j}{k_1 + \cdots + k_n} \to \frac{\lambda_j}{\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n}
\]
as $N \to \infty$, the required inequality follows from the continuity of $f$."
9_7,Convex Functions,"Show that $f \in C[a, b]$ is convex if and only if
\[
\frac{1}{t - s} \int_s^t f(x) \, dx \leq \frac{f(s) + f(t)}{2}
\]
for any $s \neq t$ in $[a, b]$.","First assume that a continuous function \( f(x) \) is convex on the interval \([a,b]\). We divide the subinterval \([s, t]\) into \(n\) equal parts and put
\[
x_k = \frac{n-k}{n}s + \frac{k}{n}t
\]
for \( 0 \leq k \leq n \). It follows from the inequality in \textbf{Problem 9.1} that
\[
f(x_k) \leq \frac{n-k}{n}f(s) + \frac{k}{n}f(t).
\]
Therefore we have
\[
\frac{1}{t-s} \int_s^t f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^n f(x_k) \leq \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2}(f(s) + f(t)) = \frac{f(s) + f(t)}{2}.
\]

Conversely assume that
\[
\frac{1}{t-s} \int_s^t f(x) \, dx \leq \frac{f(s) + f(t)}{2}
\]
for any \( s \neq t \) in \([a,b]\). Suppose, on the contrary, that there are two points \( s < t \) in the interval \([a, b]\) satisfying
\[
f\left(\frac{s+t}{2}\right) > \frac{f(s) + f(t)}{2}.
\]
Then we consider the set
\[
E = \left\{ x \in [s,t]; f(x) > f(s) + \frac{f(t) - f(s)}{t-s}(x-s) \right\}.
\]
The set \(E\) is clearly open by the continuity of \(f\) and \(E \neq \emptyset\) since it contains the point \((s+t)/2\). Note that \(E\) is the set of points on the interval \([s,t]\) at which the graph of \(f(x)\) is situated in the upper side of the straight line through the two points \((s, f(s))\) and \((t, f(t))\). Let \((u, v)\) be the connected component of \(E\) containing the point \((s+t)/2\). Since the end points \((u, f(u))\) and \((v, f(v))\) must be on that line, we have
\[
\begin{cases}
f(u) = f(s) + \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s}(u-s), \\
f(v) = f(s) + \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s}(v-s),
\end{cases}
\]
which imply that
\[
\frac{f(u) + f(v)}{2} = f(s) + \frac{f(t) - f(s)}{t-s}\left(\frac{u+v}{2}-s\right).
\]
Therefore
\[
\frac{1}{v-u} \int_u^v f(x) \, dx > \frac{1}{v-u} \int_u^v \left(f(s) + \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s}(x-s)\right) \, dx = f(s) + \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s}\left(\frac{u+v}{2}-s\right),
\]
contrary to the assumption."
